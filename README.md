# Kicks Quest - A Capstone Project

This repository holds an examination of a small business over the course of approximately three years. All data has been created using Mockaroo.com and Google Sheets, as well as some csv-json conversion websites. The data does not reflect real people or events and is curated for the use of this particular project and specific operations performed therein to complete the requirements of Code:You's Module 4 Capstone for the May 2023 Data Analysis cohort.  

The idea is based upon a custom shoe design company that profits from hand-designing originally plain pairs of high-quality shoes. Sometimes this company also sells handmade adornment pieces to display upon a pair of shoes rather than a whole new pair.

When one opens the primary file that is the Jupyter Notebook (*KicksQuest_Notebook*.ipynb), the first block includes all libraries necessary to run my project. These libraries have been documented in the requirements.txt located in the project's dedicated 'req' folder. Given that the versions of the libraries I used to create my project on my system may not exactly be the same as the libraries installed on someone else's computer system, I have opted to include Virtual Environment instructions as follows:
